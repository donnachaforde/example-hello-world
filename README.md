# example-spring-hello-world
An example of the classic "Hello World!" program in 'Spring style', as described in the [Pro Spring book](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4302-0506-7) from Apress. Consequently, this is a decoupled design, with externalized specification of the concrete classes that will ultimately be used.
## Requirements
All requirements are declared in the Maven pom file. 

 

## IDE
An IntelliJ project file called `example-spring-hello-world` is included in the root directory of the project. This uses the Maven pom file for building though you may have to configure the Maven Settings to ensure it knows where the JDK is installed and at what level of compiler-language compatibility to build at (e.g. Java 8, etc.).

## Building the project
You will need:
*   Java JDK 8 (or higher)
*   Maven
